Furthermore the user will be able to add each product to a cart, through the Add to cart button, which can be found either in the homepage or in the product.html page. 
By leveraging the use of local storage the cart progress is not lost but can be carried with ease through the different webpages, so that when the user decides to 
proceed to payment, they can click on the top right of the screen and they will be redirected to the cart summary:

Here they will be able to see the total, remove items and proceed to payment. Please note this is only a demo and there is no actual payment feature implemented, if you click on the button you will get the following message:
